# FINAL PROJECT

## Assignment Value: 15% of overall course mark.

### Description

In this final project, you will demonstrate your skills and knowledge of logic and programming in Python by creating a console application that can search and filter data from a CSV file. You will need to find a CSV file that contains at least 300 records from one of the suggested sources or any other reliable source of your choice.

### Instructions

Your application must have the following features:

- It should open the CSV file and load the data into a list.
- It should provide at least two search options for the user, such as searching by a specific column, a range of values, a keyword, a pattern, etc. You can decide what search options are suitable for your data and how to implement them.
- It should ask the user for input to search the data according to the chosen option and validate the input for errors and exceptions.
- It should save the filtered data (search results) into a separate list and display the number of records found and some summary statistics or visualizations of the data, if applicable.
- It should provide the user an option to export the filtered data to a new CSV file with a name of their choice.
- It should have at least three functions defined in a different file than the one containing the main function.
- The file containing the functions must be imported into the main file.
- The program should provide the user with a menu that displays the available options and instructions on how to use them. The menu should loop until the user chooses to exit the program by typing ‘done’.

## Suggested sources to obtain the data:

- https://www.kaggle.com/
- https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/lode/databases
- https://data.novascotia.ca/
- https://catalogue-hrm.opendata.arcgis.com/

### Grading Rubric:

Your final project will be graded according to the following criteria:

- Functionality (30 pts): Your program should run without errors and perform all the required tasks as specified in the description. It should handle invalid inputs and exceptions gracefully and provide clear feedback to the user.
- Design (20 pts): Your program should have a clear and modular structure, with appropriate use of functions, variables, data structures, and control flow. It should avoid code duplication and unnecessary complexity. It should follow all the good practices seen in the course.
- Creativity (20 pts): Your program should demonstrate some originality and creativity in terms of the data source, the search options, the summary statistics or visualizations, or any other aspects that enhance the user experience and the usefulness of your program.
- Application (30 pts): Your program should show your understanding and application of the different programming structures and concepts seen in the course, such as if, elif, else, for, while, try, except, functions, modules, I/O, etc. You should explain how and why you used these structures and concepts in your code review and in your comments.
